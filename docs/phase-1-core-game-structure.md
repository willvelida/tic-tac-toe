# Phase 1: Core Game Structure

![Status: Planned](https://img.shields.io/badge/status-Planned-blue)

This phase establishes the fundamental structure of the tic-tac-toe game, including the main game class, board representation, and player abstraction layers.

## Implementation Steps

1. **TASK-001**: Create `TicTacToe` class with board representation
   - Initialize 3x3 grid using list of lists or flat list with 9 elements
   - Define constants for empty spaces, X, and O symbols
   - Implement `__init__` method with board initialization

2. **TASK-002**: Implement board initialization (3x3 grid)
   - Create method `reset_board()` to initialize/reset game state
   - Set all positions to empty state
   - Initialize current player to X (as per traditional rules)

3. **TASK-003**: Create method to display board with position numbers
   - Implement `display_board()` method for visual representation
   - Show current board state with X, O, or position numbers (1-9)
   - Format grid with proper spacing and dividers

4. **TASK-004**: Implement player turn management (X starts first)
   - Create `current_player` attribute to track whose turn it is
   - Implement `switch_player()` method to alternate between X and O
   - Add `get_current_player()` method for external access

5. **TASK-005**: Create abstract `Player` base class for human and AI players
   - Define abstract base class with `get_move()` method
   - Include player symbol (X or O) as instance variable
   - Set up foundation for polymorphic player handling

6. **TASK-006**: Implement `HumanPlayer` class for user input handling
   - Inherit from `Player` base class
   - Implement concrete `get_move()` method for human input
   - Add input validation for position range (1-9)

## Test-Driven Development (TDD) Tests

- **TEST-P1-001**: Test board initialization creates empty 3x3 grid
- **TEST-P1-002**: Test board display shows correct format with position numbers
- **TEST-P1-003**: Test board display shows X and O symbols correctly when placed
- **TEST-P1-004**: Test current player starts as X
- **TEST-P1-005**: Test player switching alternates between X and O correctly
- **TEST-P1-006**: Test Player base class cannot be instantiated directly
- **TEST-P1-007**: Test HumanPlayer inherits from Player correctly
- **TEST-P1-008**: Test HumanPlayer stores correct symbol (X or O)
- **TEST-P1-009**: Test board reset functionality returns to initial state

## Alternatives Considered

- **ALT-P1-001**: Use dictionary for board representation with coordinate keys - Rejected in favor of simpler list structure for 3x3 grid
- **ALT-P1-002**: Use enum for player symbols instead of string constants - Deferred to keep implementation simple initially
- **ALT-P1-003**: Implement board as numpy array - Rejected due to external dependency constraint

## Risks & Assumptions

- **RISK-P1-001**: Board representation choice may impact performance - Mitigation: 3x3 grid is small enough that performance is not a concern
- **RISK-P1-002**: Abstract base class may be over-engineering for simple game - Mitigation: Provides clean foundation for Phase 3 AI implementation
- **ASSUMPTION-P1-001**: List-based board representation will be sufficient for all game operations
- **ASSUMPTION-P1-002**: Players prefer visual position numbers (1-9) over coordinate system (row, col)

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] TicTacToe class successfully initializes with empty board
- [ ] Board displays correctly with position numbers when empty
- [ ] Board displays correctly with X and O symbols when occupied
- [ ] Player turns alternate correctly starting with X
- [ ] HumanPlayer class can be instantiated with X or O symbol
- [ ] All tests pass with 100% coverage for implemented functionality
- [ ] Code follows PEP 8 style guidelines
- [ ] All methods have comprehensive docstrings

## Next Phase

Once Phase 1 is complete, proceed to [Phase 2: Game Logic](phase-2-game-logic.md) to implement move validation and win detection.
