# Phase 6: Testing & Documentation

![Status: Planned](https://img.shields.io/badge/status-Planned-blue)

This phase ensures comprehensive testing coverage, performance validation, and complete project documentation for the tic-tac-toe game.

## Implementation Steps

1. **TASK-033**: Test all win conditions (rows, columns, diagonals)
   - Verify all 8 winning combinations are detected correctly
   - Test win detection with both X and O as winners
   - Ensure win detection stops game immediately
   - Test edge cases where multiple wins could exist

2. **TASK-034**: Test draw conditions and edge cases
   - Test draw detection when board is completely full
   - Verify draw detection only triggers when no winner exists
   - Test various board states leading to draws
   - Ensure draw detection stops game correctly

3. **TASK-035**: Test input validation with various invalid inputs
   - Test out-of-range numbers (0, 10, -1, etc.)
   - Test non-numeric input (letters, symbols, empty strings)
   - Test occupied position selection
   - Test extremely long input strings and special characters

4. **TASK-036**: Test AI gameplay at different difficulty levels
   - Verify easy AI makes suboptimal moves appropriately
   - Confirm medium AI balances optimal and suboptimal play
   - Ensure hard AI never loses with optimal play
   - Test AI behavior in various game positions

5. **TASK-037**: Test game mode switching and player selection
   - Test human vs human mode functionality
   - Test human vs AI mode functionality
   - Verify player symbol selection works correctly
   - Test mode persistence across game restarts

6. **TASK-038**: Add comprehensive docstrings and comments
   - Add detailed docstrings to all classes and methods
   - Include parameter and return value documentation
   - Add inline comments for complex algorithms (minimax)
   - Follow PEP 257 docstring conventions

7. **TASK-039**: Create usage examples and documentation
   - Update README.md with installation instructions
   - Add gameplay examples and screenshots (ASCII art)
   - Document all game modes and difficulty levels
   - Include troubleshooting section

8. **TASK-040**: Performance testing for AI response times
   - Measure AI response time across different board states
   - Ensure all AI moves complete within 2 seconds
   - Test performance on various hardware configurations
   - Profile memory usage and optimize if needed

## Test-Driven Development (TDD) Tests

### Integration Tests
- **TEST-P6-001**: End-to-end test of complete human vs human game
- **TEST-P6-002**: End-to-end test of complete human vs AI game
- **TEST-P6-003**: Test complete game restart cycle
- **TEST-P6-004**: Test game statistics across multiple games

### Edge Case Tests
- **TEST-P6-005**: Test simultaneous win conditions (should not occur)
- **TEST-P6-006**: Test game behavior with rapid input
- **TEST-P6-007**: Test memory usage with extended gameplay sessions
- **TEST-P6-008**: Test behavior with unexpected system interrupts

### Performance Tests
- **TEST-P6-009**: Test AI response time under 2 seconds for all positions
- **TEST-P6-010**: Test memory usage stays within reasonable bounds
- **TEST-P6-011**: Test game startup time is acceptable
- **TEST-P6-012**: Test game handles rapid user input gracefully

### Cross-Platform Tests
- **TEST-P6-013**: Test game runs correctly on Windows
- **TEST-P6-014**: Test game runs correctly on macOS
- **TEST-P6-015**: Test game runs correctly on Linux
- **TEST-P6-016**: Test terminal compatibility across different shells

### Documentation Tests
- **TEST-P6-017**: Test all code examples in documentation work correctly
- **TEST-P6-018**: Test installation instructions are accurate
- **TEST-P6-019**: Verify all docstrings are present and correctly formatted

## Alternatives Considered

- **ALT-P6-001**: Automated testing with CI/CD pipeline - Deferred to future enhancement
- **ALT-P6-002**: Property-based testing with hypothesis library - Rejected due to external dependency
- **ALT-P6-003**: Performance benchmarking suite - Simplified to basic timing tests
- **ALT-P6-004**: Interactive documentation with examples - Deferred to focus on core functionality

## Risks & Assumptions

- **RISK-P6-001**: Testing may reveal fundamental design flaws requiring refactoring - Mitigation: Thorough testing at each phase reduces this risk
- **RISK-P6-002**: Performance tests may fail on slower hardware - Mitigation: Set reasonable performance targets and test on various systems
- **RISK-P6-003**: Cross-platform testing may reveal compatibility issues - Mitigation: Use standard Python functions and avoid OS-specific features
- **ASSUMPTION-P6-001**: Current test coverage from previous phases provides good foundation
- **ASSUMPTION-P6-002**: Manual testing combined with unit tests will provide sufficient quality assurance
- **ASSUMPTION-P6-003**: Documentation needs are satisfied with README and inline comments

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] All win and draw conditions tested with 100% coverage
- [ ] Input validation handles all edge cases correctly
- [ ] AI behavior verified at all difficulty levels
- [ ] Game modes and transitions work flawlessly
- [ ] All methods have comprehensive docstrings
- [ ] README.md provides clear installation and usage instructions
- [ ] AI response time consistently under 2 seconds
- [ ] Game works correctly on Windows, macOS, and Linux
- [ ] Memory usage remains reasonable during extended play
- [ ] All code follows PEP 8 style guidelines
- [ ] Test coverage exceeds 95% for all implemented functionality

## Project Completion

Once Phase 6 is complete, the tic-tac-toe game will be fully functional with:
- Human vs Human gameplay
- Human vs AI gameplay with multiple difficulty levels
- Comprehensive error handling and input validation
- Polished user interface and experience
- Complete testing coverage
- Professional documentation

The project will be ready for release and further enhancements as needed.
