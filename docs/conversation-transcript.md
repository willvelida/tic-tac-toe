**Repository**: [willvelida/tic-tac-toe](https://github.com/willvelida/tic-tac-toe)

## Overview

This document provides a complete transcript of the conversation that led to the creation of a comprehensive implementation plan for a terminal-based tic-tac-toe game in Python with AI opponent capabilities.

## Initial Request

**User**: "I want to build tic-tac-toe that I can play in the terminal in Python"

**Copilot Response**: 
- Fetched tic-tac-toe rules from Wikipedia for accuracy
- Examined workspace structure (LICENSE, README.md, docs/)
- Created a comprehensive 6-phase implementation plan
- Generated main plan document: `/plan/feature-terminal-tictactoe-1.md`

### Initial Plan Structure:
- **Phase 1**: Core game structure (board, basic classes)
- **Phase 2**: Player classes and game flow
- **Phase 3**: AI implementation with minimax algorithm
- **Phase 4**: User interface and input handling
- **Phase 5**: Additional features (statistics, replay)
- **Phase 6**: Testing and documentation

## Enhancement Request

**User**: "Looking at the alternative section, I want to have the ability to play an AI opponent"

**Copilot Response**:
- Confirmed AI opponent was already included in the original plan
- AI implementation planned for Phase 3 using minimax algorithm
- Three difficulty levels: Easy (30% optimal), Medium (70% optimal), Hard (100% optimal)
- Highlighted relevant sections in the plan

## Reorganization Request

**User**: "Can you move this plan into the docs folder, delete the plan folder, and then create a new document for each phase"

**Copilot Actions**:
1. Moved main plan to `/docs/feature-terminal-tictactoe-1.md`
2. Created individual phase documents:
