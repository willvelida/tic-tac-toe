# Terminal-Based Tic-Tac-Toe Game Implementation Plan

![Status: Planned](https://img.shields.io/badge/status-Planned-blue)

This implementation plan outlines the development of a terminal-based tic-tac-toe game in Python that supports both human vs human and human vs AI gameplay modes. The game will follow traditional tic-tac-toe rules where players alternate placing X's and O's on a 3x3 grid, with the objective of getting three marks in a row (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally). The AI opponent will implement strategic gameplay using the minimax algorithm for optimal play.

## 1. Requirements & Constraints

- **REQ-001**: Game must run in terminal/command line interface
- **REQ-002**: Support two human players (X and O) taking turns
- **REQ-003**: Support human vs AI gameplay mode with intelligent opponent
- **REQ-004**: Display 3x3 grid with numbered positions (1-9) for input
- **REQ-005**: Validate player moves (position must be empty and valid)
- **REQ-006**: Detect win conditions (3 in a row, column, or diagonal)
- **REQ-007**: Detect draw condition (all positions filled, no winner)
- **REQ-008**: Display clear game status and results
- **REQ-009**: Allow players to restart the game
- **REQ-010**: Handle invalid input gracefully with error messages
- **REQ-011**: Use Python 3.6+ compatibility
- **REQ-012**: Allow player to choose game mode at start (human vs human or human vs AI)
- **REQ-013**: Allow player to choose whether to play as X or O against AI
- **REQ-014**: AI should provide challenging but fair gameplay
- **SEC-001**: Input validation to prevent crashes from invalid data
- **UX-001**: Clear visual representation of the game board
- **UX-002**: Intuitive position numbering system (1-9)
- **UX-003**: Color coding or symbols to distinguish X and O clearly
- **UX-004**: Clear indication of AI moves and thinking process
- **UX-005**: Game mode selection menu with clear options
- **CON-001**: Must be single-file Python script for simplicity
- **CON-002**: No external dependencies beyond Python standard library
- **GUD-001**: Follow PEP 8 Python style guidelines
- **GUD-002**: Include comprehensive docstrings and comments
- **PAT-001**: Use object-oriented design principles
- **PAT-002**: Separate game logic from user interface logic
- **PAT-003**: Implement strategy pattern for different player types (human/AI)

## 2. Implementation Phases Overview

This project is structured into 6 distinct phases, each with its own detailed documentation:

- **[Phase 1: Core Game Structure](phase-1-core-game-structure.md)** - Basic game foundation and player classes
- **[Phase 2: Game Logic](phase-2-game-logic.md)** - Move validation, win/draw detection, and game state
- **[Phase 3: AI Implementation](phase-3-ai-implementation.md)** - Minimax algorithm and intelligent gameplay
- **[Phase 4: User Interface](phase-4-user-interface.md)** - Terminal display and input handling
- **[Phase 5: Game Flow & Polish](phase-5-game-flow-polish.md)** - Game loop, restart functionality, and UX improvements
- **[Phase 6: Testing & Documentation](phase-6-testing-documentation.md)** - Comprehensive testing and documentation

## 3. Dependencies

- **DEP-001**: Python 3.6 or higher (built-in libraries only)
- **DEP-002**: Terminal/command line environment supporting ANSI escape codes (optional for colors)
- **DEP-003**: Standard Python libraries: `sys`, `os` (for clear screen functionality)
- **DEP-004**: Standard Python libraries: `time` (for AI move delay simulation)
- **DEP-005**: Standard Python libraries: `random` (for AI difficulty variation)

## 4. Files

- **FILE-001**: `tic_tac_toe.py` - Main game implementation containing TicTacToe class, Player classes (Human/AI), and game logic
- **FILE-002**: `README.md` - Updated with game description, installation, usage instructions, and gameplay modes
- **FILE-003**: `requirements.txt` - Empty file indicating no external dependencies
- **FILE-004**: `.gitignore` - Updated to include Python-specific ignores (__pycache__, *.pyc)
- **FILE-005**: `ai_strategy.py` - Optional separate module for AI algorithms (if codebase grows large)
